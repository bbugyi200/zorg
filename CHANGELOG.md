## [0.7.2](https://github.com/bbugyi200/zorg/compare/0.7.1...0.7.2) - 2024-05-05

### Added

* Implement basic functionality for `zorg query`. We can now SELECT notes with
  a (very limited ATM) WHERE filter and GROUP BY various dimensions (e.g. file,
  note type, projects).


## [0.7.1](https://github.com/bbugyi200/zorg/compare/0.7.0...0.7.1) - 2024-05-02

### Fixed

* Stop removing 'edit' vim commands with no args.


## [0.7.0](https://github.com/bbugyi200/zorg/compare/0.6.4...0.7.0) - 2024-05-02

### Changed

* *BREAKING CHANGE*: Expect final line of keep-alive file to be the full path
  of the file in the currently focused buffer.


## [0.6.4](https://github.com/bbugyi200/zorg/compare/0.6.3...0.6.4) - 2024-04-27

### Changed

* Add `zorg query` command that does nothing ATM.
* Stop generating ZIDs which use any of the following characters based on
  similarity to digits OR because the lowercase letter hangs over an underline: `SQgipqy`

### Fixed

* Allow ZIDs and priorities in note body.
* Strip zettel dir from sql.ZorgFile.path.


## [0.6.3](https://github.com/bbugyi200/zorg/compare/0.6.2...0.6.3) - 2024-04-19

### Fixed

* Fix bug where absolute filename was used to key file hash. This was causing
  the file hash map to not be portable across different machines.

### Added

* Add `zorg db create` command that creates a sqlite database and updates all
  `*.zo` files by adding ZIDs to the notes they contain.


## [0.6.0](https://github.com/bbugyi200/zorg/compare/0.5.1...0.6.0) - 2024-03-31

### Changed

* Several improvements to the grammar used by `zorg compile`.

  the `zorg compile` command, which has not yet been integrated into a useful

### Added

  files into zorc (\*.zoc) files.
* New `ZorgFile.g4` ANTLR4 grammar and auto-generate corresponding parser, lexer, and
  listener as apart of CI.

### Changed

* *BREAKING CHANGE*: Removed `zorg action open` command's column number
  positional argument.

### Added

  signal to `zorg edit` that the same vim command should be re-run after the
  current vim instance exits.
* Add support `zorg edit` to accept file paths and/or file group names (e.g.
  `@foo`) as CLI arguments.
